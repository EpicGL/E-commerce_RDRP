## FrontEnd

To get started with the front end, follow these commands in the terminal:

```bash
cd front-end/
npm install
npm run dev
```
````

## BackEnd

To get started with the back end, follow these commands in the terminal:

```bash
cd back-end
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment. If you're using VS Code, use `Ctrl+Shift+P` and select the virtual environment. If you're using the terminal:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate   # For Unix/Linux
.\venv\Scripts\activate    # For Windows
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

Run the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Make sure you are in the `back-end` directory in the terminal, or it will not work.

```

This structure makes it easy for users to copy and paste the commands directly from the README.md file. Feel free to modify it further based on your preferences.
